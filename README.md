# flutter_blackjack

A small playfield to try oul Flutter UI with animations... the ultimate idea is to add a package with a safe few card games (no actual gambling, but ten rounds of virtual Blackjack, Texas Hold-em, etc.).

This is a first testbed of 3D flippy/spinny Flutter animations using 2D graphics....

To play with this, you will need to create a new Flutter project, and then copy these files over the existing boilerplate files.
